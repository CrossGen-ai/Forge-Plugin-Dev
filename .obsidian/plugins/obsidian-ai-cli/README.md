## Usage

### Basic Usage

![Example 2](images/example2.gif)

1. **Open a file** and/or **select text** you want to work with
2. **Open a sidebar panel** (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, or Qwen Code)
3. **Enter your prompt** in the text area
4. **Click Run** to execute

The plugin automatically:
- Detects your current file and adds it as `@filename.md`
- Includes selected text as context
- Displays the AI response in the "Result" section
- Shows command execution details and full prompt content in the collapsible section
- Uses stdin for robust handling of complex text with special characters

### Advanced Features

#### File References
Reference other files in your prompts using `@` syntax:
```
Summarize the main points from @meeting-notes.md and @project-plan.md
```

#### Context Display
The "Context" section shows:
- üìÑ Current file being referenced
- ‚úèÔ∏è Selected text (if any)

#### Split Output
- **Result**: Clean AI response, always visible
- **Command Execution**: Technical details, collapsed by default

### Example Prompts

- `Translate the selected text to French`
- `Fix grammar and spelling in this document`
- `Summarize the key points from @project-notes.md`
- `Create a todo list based on this meeting transcript`
- `Explain this code and suggest improvements`

## Troubleshooting

### CLI Tool Not Found
**Error**: "CLI tool not found. Check the path in settings."

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the CLI tool is installed and working in your terminal
2. Check the path in plugin settings
3. Try using the full path to the executable instead of just the command name
4. Restart Obsidian after changing settings

### No Context Detected
**Issue**: Plugin doesn't detect current file or selection

**Solutions**:
1. Click in the prompt text area to refresh context
2. Try switching to another file and back
3. Ensure you're in a markdown view (not reading mode)

### Gemini Shows "Loaded cached credentials"
This is automatically filtered out in the Result section but remains visible in Command Execution for debugging.

### Icons Not Showing
1. Disable and re-enable the plugin
2. Restart Obsidian
3. Check the browser console for any errors

## Configuration

### Settings Options

- **Claude Code Path**: Path to Claude Code CLI executable
- **Gemini CLI Path**: Path to Gemini CLI executable
- **OpenAI Codex Path**: Path to OpenAI Codex CLI executable
- **Qwen Code Path**: Path to Qwen Code CLI executable
