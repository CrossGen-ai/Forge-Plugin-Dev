 take the users input for implementation.

 User_input = $ARGUMENTS

 1. Develop a comphensive plan by ultra thinking and wrtiign down the plan to accomplish this tasklist. You will use specail agents to help.
 2. call the @codebase-research-analysts to reserach the code base for what is actually inplace that releates to the user request.  That agent will write down a markdown file with the research findings docs folder
 3. Then pass the research finding as well as other task descriptions to @obsidian-plugin-planner  That agent will develop a high-level plan as well as a task list and pseudo code.  It will also save the plan to the same documents folder
 4. Your job is to then implement the plan from the results of the agents and their respective markdown files.
 5. If you have ideas for improvement that are outside of the specific task asked by the user you may write them down docs/recommendations-{same uuid}.md
 6. Once all items are done and accomplished based on your assessment. Go back and reassess using the @obsidina-plugin-validator By having it assess the Plan that you just completed. Be sure to give it the file name so it can read it.  His agent should report back to any findings. It would also proactively uncheck any items that were not fully implemented.
 7.  After using the validator agent reassess the todo plan list marked down file.  For any items that were unchecked and Implement them.  Make sure you fully read the task that was unchecked to gain a full understanding.
 8.  If you had items that you just had to fix, then use the Validator agent again and continue in the loop (stesp 6-8) until all items are finished completion.
 9.  Finally write a summary report that is concise and clear in the documents folder so the user can see the final results of what was implemented and how it works.  Be sure to use Text based flow charts to explain flowflows.  Call specific files which ones were changed. With a brief description of what.

 Tracking:
 Make sure you update the to-do list in the documents folder as items are accomplished.  Do not wait until the end to update the to-do list you should do it as each task is accomplished.
