# Claude Code Best Practices

Comprehensive guide to effective Claude Code development workflows based on official Anthropic documentation and proven patterns.

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow
- Begin with high-level architectural questions
- Ask Claude to explain project structure and conventions
- Request project-specific glossaries for complex domains
- Use Plan Mode for safe, read-only code exploration

### 2. Effective Code Exploration
- Use `@filename` to reference specific files in prompts
- Reference entire directories with `@directory/`
- Leverage Plan Mode (`claude --permission-mode plan`) for analysis
- Ask for code walkthroughs before making changes

### 3. Iterative Development
- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
- Use extended thinking for complex architectural decisions
- Iterate and refine solutions based on feedback
- Verify each step before proceeding to the next

## Workflow Optimization

### Custom Slash Commands
Create reusable commands for common tasks:

**Personal Commands** (`~/.claude/commands/`)
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities:" > ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
echo "Analyze performance and suggest optimizations:" > ~/.claude/commands/optimize.md
```

**Project Commands** (`.claude/commands/`)
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands
echo "Fix issue #\$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards" > .claude/commands/fix-issue.md
echo "Generate comprehensive PR description for recent changes" > .claude/commands/pr-desc.md
```

### Git Integration Best Practices
- Use `claude commit` for AI-assisted commit messages
- Let Claude analyze git diff before committing
- Use Git worktrees for parallel development sessions
- Integrate Claude into CI/CD for code verification

### File Organization
- Keep `.claude/` directory in version control
- Share project-specific commands with team
- Use consistent naming conventions for commands
- Document custom tools and workflows in project README

## Security Best Practices

### Permission Management
```json
{
  "allowedTools": [
    "Read",
    "Bash(git status:*)",
    "Bash(git diff:*)",
    "Bash(git log:*)"
  ],
  "disallowedTools": [
    "Bash(rm:*)",
    "Bash(sudo:*)"
  ]
}
```

### Sensitive Data Protection
- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Review all code changes before committing
- Use hooks to validate operations before execution

### Tool Safety
- Start with restrictive permissions, gradually expand
- Use Plan Mode for code analysis without modifications
- Implement PreToolUse hooks for validation
- Regularly audit tool usage logs

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Prompting
- Be specific about what you want Claude to analyze or change
- Use file references (`@file.js`) instead of copying code
- Break large tasks into smaller, focused requests
- Provide clear context about project goals and constraints

### Resource Management
- Use appropriate models for different tasks (Haiku for simple tasks)
- Limit conversation length with `/clear` when context becomes stale
- Utilize subagents for specialized tasks
- Monitor API usage and costs

### Codebase Navigation
- Create a project glossary for domain-specific terms
- Maintain up-to-date architecture documentation
- Use consistent coding conventions across the project
- Document unusual patterns or architectural decisions

## Collaboration Patterns

### Team Workflows
- Share custom slash commands via version control
- Document team-specific Claude workflows
- Use consistent prompt patterns across team members
- Create onboarding documentation for new team members

### Code Review Integration
- Generate comprehensive PR descriptions
- Use Claude for initial code review before human review
- Document architectural decisions with Claude's help
- Maintain consistent code quality standards

### Documentation Practices
- Generate JSDoc comments for undocumented functions
- Create API documentation from code analysis
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Document complex business logic and edge cases

## Advanced Techniques

### MCP Integration
- Connect external tools and services via MCP servers
- Use MCP resources for enhanced context (`@server:resource`)
- Create custom MCP tools for project-specific needs
- Leverage community MCP servers for common integrations

### Subagent Utilization
- Delegate specialized tasks to focused subagents
- Use different agents for different types of work (testing, documentation, refactoring)
- Maintain agent configurations in version control
- Document agent capabilities and use cases

### Automation Patterns
- Use headless mode for scripting and automation
- Integrate Claude into CI/CD pipelines
- Create hooks for automatic code quality checks
- Automate routine maintenance tasks

## Troubleshooting and Debugging

### Common Issues
- **Permission Errors**: Check `allowedTools` configuration
- **Context Loss**: Use `/clear` and re-establish context
- **Tool Failures**: Review hook configurations and permissions
- **MCP Issues**: Verify server connectivity and credentials

### Debugging Strategies
- Check transcript files in `.claude/projects/` for conversation history
- Review hook outputs and error logs
- Use Plan Mode to safely explore problematic code
- Break complex problems into smaller, testable pieces

### Error Recovery
- Use `/clear` to reset conversation state
- Restart Claude Code session if tools become unresponsive
- Check system resources and network connectivity
- Review and update configuration files

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Standards
- Establish and document coding conventions
- Use Claude for consistent code formatting
- Implement automated quality checks via hooks
- Regular code review with both Claude and human reviewers

### Testing Integration
- Generate test cases based on code analysis
- Use Claude to identify edge cases and error conditions
- Automate test generation for new features
- Maintain test documentation and coverage reports

### Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review and update custom commands
- Gather feedback on Claude-generated code
- Update workflows based on team learnings
- Monitor and optimize development velocity

## Model Selection Guidelines

### Task-Appropriate Models
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku**: Simple tasks, quick responses, cost optimization
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Balanced performance for most development tasks
- **Claude 3 Opus**: Complex reasoning, architectural decisions, critical code

### Cost Optimization
- Use model configuration in command frontmatter
- Monitor usage patterns and costs
- Optimize prompt length and context
- Use appropriate tools for different task types

## Integration Strategies

### IDE Integration
- Use Claude Code alongside your preferred IDE
- Leverage terminal integration for seamless workflow
- Configure status line for real-time information
- Use keyboard shortcuts for common Claude operations

### External Tools
- Integrate with project management tools
- Connect to monitoring and logging systems
- Use database and API documentation tools
- Leverage design and documentation platforms
